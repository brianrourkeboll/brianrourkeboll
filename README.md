Software developer, erstwhile linguistics dilettante.

I think statically-typed functional programming is a pretty good idea. I'm also interested in language tooling, library ergonomics, error-handling techniques, code legibility and comprehensibility, end-to-end testing, and property-based testing.

I've recently been making some [contributions to the F# compiler and tooling](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Abrianrourkeboll&type=pullrequests).
