- [x] Software developer, erstwhile linguistics dilettante.
- [ ] **Fall 2023**: I'm currently looking for a new job.
  
  I think statically-typed functional programming is a pretty good idea, and I'd like to do more of it, but I'm more interested in the people and the problem than the tech stack.

  I'm experienced in back-end engineering of many kinds, system design and evolution, distributed systems, Kafka, various cloud technologies, library design and maintenance, full-stack prototyping, etc., etc.

  Reach out to me at my GitHub handle at gmail.com or on LinkedIn if you want to chat.
